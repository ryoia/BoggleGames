- One of the tests may fail if they are being ran at the same time.

Updated for PS9:
- Unit Test for GUI always stop before the recording was finished. That's why the code coverage is low.
Notes on Boggle Client View's unit test:
- The code coverage for BoggleClientModel is 100%, the total coverage is lower due to BoggleBoard and BoggleServer classes
- I created a copy of Debug folder in BoggleServer class, then ran the BoggleServer.exe file in the copy folder, then run the tests
